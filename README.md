## 1. Core Philosophy

Ligare is a minimalist programming language. It recognizes only one kind of entity — the **Term**.  
There is no separate "type" syntax, no "type vs. value" dichotomy, and no "program vs. proof" dichotomy.  
Everything is a term, and every relationship is a **constraint**.

## 2. Terms and Constraints

### 2.1 Terms
A term is the only existence in the language. Variables, literals, functions, data types, propositions, proofs, macros... all are terms.

### 2.2 Constraints
Relationships between terms are established through **constraints**.  
`a : T` means that term `a` is constrained by term `T` (i.e., `a` has type `T`).  
The constraint relationship replaces the "type ascription" found in traditional languages, but constraints themselves are also terms and can be constrained by other terms.

**Example**  
```ligare
3 : int       -- 3 is constrained by int
int : data    -- int is constrained by data
```

### 2.3 Levels
All terms have a level. Constraint relationships enforce level ordering to prevent Russell-paradox-style self-referential structures.  
(Specific level rules will be defined in detail in the formalization section.)

### 2.4 Naming Conventions
- **Constraints / Types**: PascalCase (e.g., `Nat`, `Point`, `LinkedList`)
- **Functions / Theorems**: snake_case (e.g., `div`, `is_sorted`, `add_node`)

## 3. Meta-Constraints

The language has four built-in root constraints, called **meta-constraints**. They define the foundation of the universe.

| Meta-constraint | Meaning | Exists at runtime? |
|-----------------|---------|---------------------|
| `data` | The computable data universe; all terms ultimately retained belong here | Yes |
| `prop` | The proposition universe, describing logical conditions | No (erased) |
| `theorem` | An established proposition, encapsulating a proof | No (erased) |
| `proof` | The concrete construction of a proof; an evidence term | No (erased) |

All user-defined constraints are ultimately rooted beneath these four meta-constraints.

## 4. Refinement Constraints (Where Clauses)

Users can define new constraints by refining an existing constraint with a predicate. This is Ligare's way of defining "subtypes."

**Syntax**  
```ligare
def nat := int where (x => x >= 0)
```

**Interpretation**  
`nat` is a new constraint. Any term constrained by `nat` must:
1. Be constrained by `int` (which itself is constrained by `data`);
2. Satisfy the predicate `x >= 0`.

**Usage**  
```ligare
def x : nat := 10
#check x : nat       -- passes
#check x : int       -- also passes (nat is a subtype of int)
#check -5 : nat      -- fails: -5 is not >= 0
```

The compiler automatically demands this proof where needed, or derives it from context.

Multiple refinements can coexist in the same program:
```ligare
def pos   := int where (x => x > 0)
def even  := int where (x => x % 2 = 0)
def ten   := int where (x => x = 10)
```

Refinements can also be used inline in function parameters:
```ligare
def sdiv (a : int) (b : int where (x => x /= 0)) : int := a / b
```

## 5. Functions

Functions are defined with `def` (or `func`), using curried parameter lists. They can constrain their own parameters via `where` clauses, forming pre-condition contracts.

**Syntax example**  
```ligare
def div (a : int) (b : int where (x => x /= 0)) : int := a / b
```

**Proof obligations**  
- The caller must provide a proof that `b /= 0` (or the compiler derives it automatically).
- The function body operates under the guarantee that the parameter constraints hold.

All proof terms (`proof`) are erased after passing compile-time checks, with zero runtime overhead.

**Function with no return type annotation**  
```ligare
def id (x : int) := x
```

**Recursive function**  
```ligare
def fib (n : int) : int :=
  if n < 2 then n else fib (n - 1) + fib (n - 2)
```

## 6. `if` Expressions and Theorem Introduction

The condition of an `if` is treated as a proposition. When entering a branch, the branch context automatically introduces a corresponding `theorem`.

**Example**  
```ligare
if x > 0 then
  -- a theorem: x > 0 is automatically available here
  -- it can be used to satisfy proof obligations of other constraints
  div 10 x  -- x /= 0 can be automatically derived from x > 0
else
  -- a theorem: not (x > 0) is automatically available here
```

After compilation, `if` is still compiled into a simple conditional jump; all proof parts are erased.

## 7. Proofs and Tactics (Lean 4-style `by` blocks)

Ligare supports interactive proof construction via `by` blocks with tactics, inspired by Lean 4.

**Simple proof with `exact`**  
```ligare
#check 5 by
  exact true : nat
```

**Multi-tactic proof with `intro`**  
```ligare
#check 0 by
  intro
  exact 0 : int -> int
```

**Standalone proof term (no subject)**  
```ligare
#check (by
  intro
  exact 0) : int -> int
```

**Applying a proof immediately**  
```ligare
#show (by
  intro
  exact 0) 5
```

Available tactics:
- `exact <term>` — provide a term that satisfies the goal directly
- `intro [name]` — introduce a Pi-type hypothesis
- `apply <term>` — apply a function to reduce the goal
- `have <name> := <term>` — introduce a lemma

## 8. Expressions and Let Bindings

### Lambda expressions
```ligare
\x. x + 1
\a. \b. a + b
```

### Let expressions
```ligare
let x := 5 in x + 3
let x : int := 5 in x
let x := 5 in let y := x + 1 in y * 2
```

### Type annotation
```ligare
(5 : int)
(5 : nat) by exact true
```

### Function (Pi) types
```ligare
int -> bool               -- non-dependent arrow
(x : int) -> x            -- dependent arrow
```

### Proposition combinators
```ligare
∧ P Q    -- conjunction: P ∧ Q
∨ P Q    -- disjunction: P ∨ Q
¬ P      -- negation: ¬P
```

## 9. Structs *(planned)*

> ⚠️ This feature is not yet implemented. The syntax below represents the intended design.

A struct is a compound term constrained by `data`, containing named fields and optional invariants.

**Planned syntax**
```ligare
def Point : data := struct
  x : int
  y : int
invariant: x >= 0 ∧ y >= 0
```

**Construction**
When constructing `Point`, a `proof` that the invariant holds must be provided.
The compiler will automatically generate:
- A constructor (with proof obligations)
- Field projection functions
- A `theorem` corresponding to the invariant (e.g., for any `p : Point`, `p.x >= 0` is an available theorem)

## 10. Compile-Time Metaprogramming *(planned)*

> ⚠️ This feature is not yet implemented. The syntax below represents the intended design.

The `proof` universe also serves the role of metaprogramming.
Any program used solely for generating `data` code can be written as a `proof` term, evaluated at compile time and spliced in.

**Planned mechanism**
```ligare
-- Quote: converts a code fragment into manipulable AST data
`( x + 1 )

-- Splice: inserts the AST produced by evaluating a proof term back into data context
$( proof_term )
```

**Safety guarantee**
During splicing, the generated code is forcibly verified to satisfy the target constraint; otherwise compilation fails.

Since `proof` is ultimately erased, the metaprogramming parts never enter the runtime.

## 11. Top-Level Commands

Ligare programs consist of a sequence of top-level commands:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `def <name> <params>? : <type>? := <body>` | Define a named term or function |
| `theorem <name> : <type> := <body>` | Define a named theorem (type-checked, then available as a term) |
| `#check <expr> : <type>` | Type-check an expression against a constraint |
| `#show <expr>` | Evaluate an expression and display the result |

**Example program**  
```ligare
def nat := int where (x => x >= 0)
def x : nat := 10
theorem x_is_nat : nat := x by
  exact true

#check x : int
#show x
```

## 12. Compilation and Erasure

The compilation process is divided into two major phases:

1. **Constraint checking and proof verification**  
   Perform constraint checking on all terms and verify that all `proof` obligations are satisfied.

2. **Erasure and code generation**  
   Retain all terms constrained by `data`, and remove all terms constrained by `prop`, `theorem`, or `proof`.  
   The final product is pure, zero-overhead executable code.

## 13. Summary

Ligare uses the single core concept of **"terms constrained by terms"** to unify:
- The type system
- Propositions and proofs
- Design by contract
- Refinement types
- Compile-time metaprogramming *(planned)*

It pursues **the extreme of static safety with zero runtime burden**, while maintaining a minimal set of concepts.  
This document describes the currently implemented syntax and planned features; formal definitions, operational semantics, and implementation details will be added progressively.
